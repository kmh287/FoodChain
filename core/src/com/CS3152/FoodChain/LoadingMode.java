/**
 * Class that provides a loading screen for the state of the game.
 *
 * You still DO NOT need to understand this class for this lab.  We will talk about this
 * class much later in the course.  This class provides a basic template for a loading
 * screen to be used at the start of the game or between levels.  Feel free to adopt
 * this to your needs.
 *
 * You will note that this mode has some textures that are not loaded by the AssetManager.
 * You are never required to load through the AssetManager.  But doing this will block
 * the application.  That is why we try to have as few resources as possible for this
 * loading screen.
